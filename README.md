### Step 1: Add Prisma-Goat Styles

In the root layout of your project (e.g., `MyApp` or `Layout`), include the Prisma-Goat CSS file. For example:

```javascript
import "prisma-goat/dist/prisma-goat.css";
import "./globals.css";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className="antialiased">
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Button Component

Prisma-Goat also provides a Button component for seamless UI integration. Example usage:

```javascript
import { Button } from 'prisma-goat';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked!')}>
      Click Me
    </Button>
  );
}
```
